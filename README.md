# Let Me Work
Let Me Work is a command line tool for Linux/OSX that keeps you logged in to Wi-Fi hotspots that require you re-accept terms and conditions evey so often.

### Inspiration
The drive to create this project came from many days working in my local Colectivo coffee shop where yes, it kicked me off every hour.
